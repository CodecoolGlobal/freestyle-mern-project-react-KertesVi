# PurrHaven app

For our team project, we were tasked with building a MERN application from scratch, incorporating an external API. We had complete creative freedom over the project's design and style. After reviewing the list of available APIs, we chose the reliable Cat API (https://thecatapi.com/). Through brainstorming, we developed the idea for a cat adoption site, which we named "PurrHaven."

We divided the tasks and often worked individually on branches, but also collaborated using Live Share. We enjoyed solving problems together and were enthusiastic as the project started taking shape just as we envisioned. We didn’t focus on whose solution or push it was—it was truly a team effort. However, we'll try and highlight our individual contributions.

## Overview

PurrHaven is a website where you can adopt cats or donate money to support them if you’re unable to adopt. It features a page with success stories, a donation page, and a section where you can learn useful information about different cat breeds. There are also login and registration pages. The app has the potential to expand further by incorporating food donations or allowing other animal services to join.
